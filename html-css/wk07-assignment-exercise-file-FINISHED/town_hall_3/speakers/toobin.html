					<p>Jeffrey Toobin, CNN chief legal analyst and a renowned reporter for <cite>The New Yorker</cite> will be speaking on how to juggle your business and personal affairs using proper etiquette over Zoom. He will also touch on the prevelance of voluntary surveillance, where there's a camera on almost everywhere and all the time, usually turned on by one's own hand.</p>

					<p>Toobin was suspended from both organizations on October 19 after an unfortunate Zoom failure. The reason: He exposed himself during a Zoom call with colleagues in what he says was an accident.</p>
					<p>The New Yorker said that it had suspended Toobin following the incident, and said it was investigating the matter. The suspension was first reported by Vice on Monday.</p>
					<p>A spokesperson for CNN said "Jeff Toobin has asked for some time off while he deals with a personal issue, which we have granted."</p>
					<p>Neither news outlet said how long Toobin would be out.</p>
			
					<p>"I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera," Toobin said. "I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers."</p>
					<p>"I believed I was not visible on Zoom," he added. "I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video."</p>
